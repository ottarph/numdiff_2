## Project 2, TMA4212 Numerical Solution of Differential Equations with Difference Methods
#### Ottar Hellan and Anders Hoel

The classes defining the partial differential equations and the functionality we use to analyse them are stored in `pde_sparse.py` and `epi_sparse.py`. The programs to generate the plots, `plots.py` and `epidemic_plots.py`, import these classes and functions. To generate the plots, simply run `plots.py` and `epidemic_plots.py` and they will be show up, although `plots.py` might take quite some time to run.

The report itself is in the file `TMA4212_Project2_Ottar_Hellan_and_Anders_Hoel.pdf`.
